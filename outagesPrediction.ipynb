    "# Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "The dataset comes from the link https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918307182 and it contains major power outage events within the US from January 2000 to July 2016. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in this dataset because outages cause disruption to everyone’s lives and it is worthy to study them. Since most of the column names are abbreviated,  we first used the data dictionary to understand what the columns represent. Moreover, the data set consists of 55 variables and over 1.5k observations; the data spans over 16 years. The dataset contains data of the date/time,region,price of electricity, population, and etc of the outages that occured.\n",
    "\n",
    "To our surprise, this dataset is pertinent to our prediction question of “Predict the total customers affected by an outage” because it contains a myriad of relevant information such as ‘year’, ‘location’, ‘climate region’, and other socioeconomic data such as GDP/population density. Thus, based on the data richness of this dataset, we can narrow down our prediction question to build a robust algorithm to predict accurately the total customers affected by  \n",
    "\n",
    "This problem will be a classification problem becuase we will try to predict if the number of customers affected by an outage was greater than or less than the mean of the customers affect. The target variable will be the customers affected columns in the dataset, which is represented by the total amount of customers affected by the outage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline Model\n",
    "\n",
    "For our baseline model, we decided to do the most simple things to get a result. When we chose the columns, we thought about the columns that would have the most inpact on our outcome column, customers affected. The process behind the selection was not done through anything special, but merely just using common sense and thinking which columns would be correlated with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we put our values in, we decided to do some model cleaning in order to take in account for the null values in the dataset. We decided not to drop any null values because the rows could have columns that have values that would effect the outcome of our machine learning model. For most of the quantitative value columns we simply imputed them with the mean or median values in order to keep the distribution of the column near the center, but this could possibly lead to errors later on in the model. We decided with the mean and median because we did not want to increase variance and biases into the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "For our categorical columns, we decided to use one hot encoding so that the string values can be associated by some integer in order for the machine learning model to run. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to those executions performed on the dataset, we decided to binarize some columns. The columns are mostly the ones after performing data imputation on the null values. Doing this would remove all noise from the model because everything would be binarized, so outliers will not have an effect on our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "After running the the model, our accuracy for our baseline is around 59%. This was done with the the Support Vector Machine Classifier and no hyperparamter tuning. The classification algoirthm was just chosen at random, and because we thought it would perform the best of all the classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Model\n",
    "After our horrible performance on our baseline model, we wanted design a better pipeline for our machine learning model. We brainstormed ideas on what columns to add, what feature engineering to perform, and what classifiers we could possibly use to improve our final score. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we did was to included the time and date columns, since we figure that they may play a huge factor into how many people are affected. For instance, if the the outage occurs at midnight, when majority of people are sleeping, then the total number of affected will be lower compared to an outage that occurs during mid-day. We binarized most of the quantitative column for simplicity, but we will consider scaling them as derived features for our improved model. So we decided to do some feature engineering. We converted the 'OUTAGE.START.DATE' and 'OUTAGEE.START.TIME' to pd.Timestamps objects, then we used the .weekday() and .hour() functions to extract the weekday and hour of the outage. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we did was to standardize the 'OUTAGE.START.DATE', 'OUTAGE.START.TIME', and 'OUTAGE.DURATION\". We decided to do this because we wanted to make them be on the same comparison scale. We also decided to Log-scale the  TOTAL.CUSTOMERS column. We decided to this because we didnt want our column to have a huge skew and in a sense bring the extreme values closer to the distirbution of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our classifer, we decided to use Decision Trees. After running many classifers, the decision tree gave us the highest score of all the other classifiers. All other colunmns and process were kept the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final accuracy score we got was over 88%. This is roughly 30% improvement in accuracy from our baseline model. This was due to the change of classification algorithm and adding feature engineering to our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fairness Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to split our data by 'TOTAL.PRICE' into two groups. Namely, we used the median of the 'TOTAL.PRICE\" as a threshold and consequently labeled data points that are below the median as 'cheap' and 'expensive' otherwise. We are particularly interested in this business ethical question after conducting a mini EDA since we saw that the recall scores across the price ranges in the dataset look fairly equal.  We wanted to use a permutation test to figure out if our model will be biased to perform better for more 'expensive' electricity. \n",
    "\n",
    "The performance metrics we chose for our fairness evaluation are F1 score and recall score. We refrained from using simply the accuracy score because it doesn’t portray a full picture of the imbalance in data. Thus, we chose to use recall, or True Positive Rate, and F1, which is harmonic mean of recall and specificity to judge the fairness of our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We shuffled the price labels using a permutation tests and our null hypothesis is that our test statistic, which is the difference in recall and F1 score, come from the same distribution. Using a 5% significance level, our p values > 0.05. We fail to reject our null hypothesis, which infers that our model is fair in determining the total customers affected across both cheap and expensive avg. electricity price.  "
